    /// Destroys the networked GameObject either by PhotonNetwork.Destroy or by sending an RPC which calls Object.Destroy().
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Using an RPC to Destroy a GameObject is typically a bad idea.
    /// It allows any player to Destroy a GameObject and may cause errors.
    ///
    /// A client has to clean up the server's event-cache, which contains events for Instantiate and
    /// buffered RPCs related to the GO.
    /// 
    /// A buffered RPC gets cleaned up when the sending player leaves the room, so players joining later
    /// won't get those buffered RPCs. This in turn, may mean they don't destroy the GO due to coming later.
    ///
    /// Vice versa, a GameObject Instantiate might get cleaned up when the creating player leaves a room.
    /// This way, the GameObject that a RPC targets might become lost.
    ///
    /// It makes sense to test those cases. Many are not breaking errors and you just have to be aware of them.
